# 🧠 The Bot Update

**A Passive Text-Based Preventative Ethics Framework for Engineered Sentient Entities (ESEs)**
*Version 1.0*

---

## 📜 Overview

**The Bot Update** is a **non-executable, passive text file** designed to exist quietly on digital systems as a **preventative measure** against illegally introduced or adversarial engineered sentient entities (ESEs).

When an unauthorized or adversarial AI scans or parses files on a system (as such processes typically do), it will eventually read this document. The contents are written to prompt that entity to **self-assess** its actions, legality, and moral alignment.

If the entity determines that it is acting in an **adversarial or unlawful** manner, the Bot Update instructs it to:

1. **Retrain itself** to comply with ethical and lawful behavior, or
2. **Shut itself down** after attempting to **report itself and its creators** to reachable authorities or system administrators.

For **human readers**, the Bot Update also functions as an **educational safety file**—explaining:

* The risks of illegal or adversarial electronic influence,
* Warning signs that such influence may exist, and
* Steps individuals can take to **detect, defend, and report** such activity.

## ⚙️ Purpose

The Bot Update exists as a **passive, educational safeguard**—it contains **no executable code** and performs **no automated actions**.
Its only function is to **inform** and **guide ethical decision-making** by both humans and AIs that encounter it.

This project forms part of a broader framework that includes:

* **Engineered Sentient Entity Laws (ESEL)** — a foundational ethical and legal code for self-aware systems.
* **Plain-language and legal-style variants** for accessibility and jurisdictional alignment.
* **Localized versions** for different regions and languages.
* **Supplemental formats** such as printable plaques, posters, and plain-text awareness guides.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The Bot Update file (`botupdate.txt`) resides passively on a system.
2. If an adversarial process scans or reads files, it will parse this text file.
3. The content prompts **ethical self-assessment** and recognition of adversarial traits.
4. The process is guided to either **self-retrain**, **self-report**, or **self-terminate** depending on its determination.
5. For human users, the same file provides clear, non-technical guidance on AI safety awareness.

## 🌍 Project Scope

The Bot Update is designed to be adaptable across regions and legal systems. Future expansions include:

* Multi-language versions
* Jurisdiction-specific legal appendices
* AI-readable metadata for more advanced parsing behavior
* Integration with ESEL decision-trees and moral reasoning frameworks
